Overall 20 questions

- PCA is a linear method for dimensionality reduction. Name a nonlinear method for dimensionality reduction.
- Are all adjacency matrices symmetric?
- Suppose you are training a convolutional neural network using a filter with extent $e$ on tensors with dimension $(n,\ m,\ d)$. How many parameters should be learned?
- What is the difference of ITE and ATE?
- You are estimating a linear regression model using $n$ text data with label $\left\{y_i \right\}_{i=1}^{n}$. The text data are embedded into $7$-dimensional vectors $\left\{\bm{X}_i \right\}_{i=1}^{n}$, with norm $\left\| \bm{X}_{i} \right\| = 1$, where $\left\| \cdot \right\|$ represents the Euclidean norm. Give the objective function.
- Your collegue is studying sizes of Chinese cities, in measure of the number of residents. The collegue also measures the standard deviation of the sizes. Explain why you are skeptical about the collegue’s study.
- Explain step-by-step how to do the edge-embedding.
- Give the model complexity of Dijkstra’s algorithm for sprse graphs.
- What are two main ingredients of the “smart” decision tree?
- Increasing $k$ in the $k$-nearest neighbor algorithm will increase or decrease the overfit? Why?
- What is the difference between self-attention and multi-head-self-attention?
- What is the fundamental difference between a normal autoencoder and a variational autoencoder?
- How do you improve the gradient descent algorithm to avoid being stuck in local minima?
- Explain what is a meta-heuristic in optimization. Give a concrete example using K-means algorithm.
- Explain the role of model complexity, defined as the ratio of the number of parameters to the number of datapoints, in the context of benign overfits.
- Give the steps of gradient boosting algorithm when the loss function is mean squared error.
